Skins should be applied first, then you can apply any combination of points, energy capsules, and title and select screens, then any further customization options.
 
This is because all skins contain copies of those elements so that when switching back from Roll to a Megaman skin, you'll have the correct title and select screen rather than the Roll-chan versions.

So:

1. Skins
2a. Points
2b. Energy Capsules
2c. Title and Select Screen
2d. Any further customization
3. any Further Customization options
